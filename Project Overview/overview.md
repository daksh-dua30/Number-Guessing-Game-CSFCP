# Project Overview – Number Guessing Game

The Number Guessing Game is a simple Python-based console project where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts. The project is designed to demonstrate the use of basic Python programming concepts, including loops, conditional statements, user input handling, exception handling, and random number generation.

The game provides hints after each guess, informing the user whether the guess is too high or too low. The player is given a maximum of 10 attempts to find the correct number. Proper input validation ensures that only numeric values are accepted, preventing errors during execution.

This project was built to practice and understand:
- Python fundamentals  
- Basic game logic  
- Handling runtime exceptions  
- Structuring a clean and readable Python script  
- Using VS Code and GitHub as development tools  

Overall, this mini project reflects the practical application of core programming and version control skills required in early software development.
