# Future Improvements – Number Guessing Game

Although the current version of the Number Guessing Game works well as a console-based mini project, several enhancements can be added in the future to improve functionality and user experience:

## 1. Difficulty Levels
Introduce modes such as:
- Easy (1–50, 10 attempts)
- Medium (1–100, 7 attempts)
- Hard (1–500, 5 attempts)

## 2. Graphical User Interface (GUI)
The game can be rebuilt using:
- Tkinter
- PyQt
- Kivy  
This would turn the console game into a more interactive visual application.

## 3. Scoreboard System
Track:
- Number of wins  
- Attempts used  
- Best score  
Scores could be saved in a file or database.

## 4. Replay Option
Add an option for the user to play again without restarting the program.

## 5. Randomized Hints
Add varied hint styles or guidance like:
- "You're very close!"
- "You're far off!"
  
## 6. Sound Effects and Colors
Use libraries like `colorama` or `winsound` (Windows only) to make the game more engaging.

## 7. Multi-Round Mode
Allow the player to play multiple rounds and display final game statistics.

These improvements can help develop more advanced Python skills while enhancing the game's overall experience.
